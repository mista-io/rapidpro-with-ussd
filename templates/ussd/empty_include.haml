      Handlers let you easily support different aggregator APIs.

      Each aggregator or USSD provider has a different API, but at the core of it all, they return the same
      information only named differently. For example Africa's Talking might send you a request with this payload
      %code
        {
          "sessionID":"23587468578475832",
          "serviceCode":"*267*7#",
          "phoneNumber":"250787411849",
          "input":"2",
          "timeStamp":"1643874789834"
        }
      %br
        %br
        Another aggregator say telcom B can send you a request with this payload
        %code
          {
            "session":"23587468578475832",
            "shortCode":"*267*7#",
            "msisdn":"250787411849",
            "text":"2",
            "timestamp":"1643874789834"
          }
        %br
        %br
          Note that this is the same information but the nomenclature differs from aggregator to aggregator.
          Therefore the system helps you create a standard for this varying nomenclature.
          <br>
          The logic requires you to mandatory map the above to these
          %code
            session_id, short_code, from, text
        %br
        %br
          An aggregator may send extra parameters but we do not mind about them as long as the above are mapped.
        %br
        %br
          The same applies for the expected response. Different aggregators expect responses in different formats.
          At the handler is where we configure all this.

            Note that this module strictly user only channel types of "External API". In order to configure a handler,
            rush to
            %code /channels/types/external/claim
            and configure an external channel then come back.
